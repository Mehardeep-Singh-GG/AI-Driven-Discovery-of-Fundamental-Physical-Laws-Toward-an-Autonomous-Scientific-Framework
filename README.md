# AI-Driven Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws

Welcome to the **AI-Driven Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws** project. This repository implements an autonomous scientific framework that leverages artificial intelligence to discover novel physical laws. The framework is inspired by the paper:

> **AI-Driven Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws: Toward an Autonomous Scientific Framework**

Rather than merely rediscovering known equations, our system explores an infinite symbolic space under physical constraints (such as dimensional consistency, symmetry, and noise robustness) to derive new candidate equations. Additionally, a rigorous experimental validation module is provided to assess the candidates via simulated experimental protocols.

## Overview

This project integrates techniques from symbolic regression, evolutionary optimization, and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously discover candidate equations that adhere to fundamental physical principles. The framework is divided into two primary modules:

1. **Mehar’s Algorithm:**  
   Automatically generates and evolves candidate equations using a symbolic representation, evolutionary operations, and RL-based parameter tuning.

2. **Gurarpit’s Validation Module:**  
   Validates candidate equations by simulating experimental protocols, translating the symbolic expressions into observables, and evaluating them with a composite validation cost function.

Both modules emphasize modularity, rigor, and reproducibility with comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Modules

### Mehar’s Algorithm (Symbolic Equation Discovery)

- **Objective:**  
  Generate candidate equations from an infinite symbolic space while enforcing constraints such as dimensional consistency, symmetry, and noise robustness.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Symbolic Representation:**  
    Candidate equations are encoded as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using a formal grammar.
  - **Iterative Deepening & Monte Carlo Sampling:**  
    The algorithm progressively increases the complexity of the generated expressions.
  - **Penalty Metrics:**  
    Multiple penalties are applied, including:
    - **Theoretical Consistency Error (Λ(E))**
    - **Complexity Penalty (C(E))**
    - **Dimensional Penalty (D(E))**
    - **Noise Sensitivity Penalty (N(E))**
    - **Symmetry Penalty (S(E))**
  - **Evolutionary Optimization:**  
    Mutation, crossover, and tournament selection operators evolve the candidate equations.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:**  
    A Q-learning agent dynamically tunes evolutionary parameters (such as mutation and crossover probabilities) based on candidate performance.

### Gurarpit’s Validation Module (Experimental Validation)

- **Objective:**  
  Rigorously validate candidate equations by simulating experimental protocols and computing a composite validation cost.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Experimental Protocols:**  
    Randomly generated sequences of experimental steps (e.g., measurements and injections).
  - **Babel Operator:**  
    Translates a candidate symbolic expression into a simulated observable over a fixed time grid while incorporating protocol actions.
  - **Reverse Engineering:**  
    Audits the candidate’s derivational history to quantify the cumulative transformation error.
  - **Error Metrics:**  
    Evaluates the candidate using:
    - **Simulation Deviation (RMSE)**
    - **Experimental Reproducibility**
    - **Protocol Complexity**
  - **RL Adaptation:**  
    An RL agent adapts simulation parameters (e.g., noise amplitude) to improve validation accuracy.

## Paper Summary

The underlying paper presents a paradigm where AI acts as an **autonomous theorist**—a system that autonomously explores a vast space of mathematical expressions constrained by fundamental principles (such as symmetry and dimensional consistency). Instead of rediscovering known laws (e.g., Einstein’s field equations), the framework aims to uncover new, unified theories like the **Unified Emergent Field Equation (UEFE)**, which incorporates nonlocal terms and fractional derivatives to bridge classical and quantum physics.
